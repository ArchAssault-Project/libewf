Building .deb files
To build .deb files make sure you've have installed debhelper, dpkg-buildpackage and fakeroot
* copy the dpkg directory to debian
* run "dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot"
  this will create the .deb files in the parent directory


Building .rpm files
To build .rpm files make sure you've have installed rpmbuild
* rename the distrubted tar.gz file if necessary; applies to experimental, alpha and beta versions
  "mv libewf-alpha-<version>.tar.gz libewf-<version>.tar.gz"
* run "rpmbuild -ta libewf-<version>.tar.gz"
  this will create the .rpm files in the rpmbuild tree, commonly ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/...
